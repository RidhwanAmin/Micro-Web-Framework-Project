Run using "npm run dev"

Story 1 <br>
In order to store and use my pictures online (or through a "Service"),
As an Anonymous user,
I want to attach a picture to the Service,
And I want to have a permanent link to this picture,
Otherwise, I want to be rejected and informed if the file is not a picture.
